docs-how-to-contribute
======================
COMING SOON

This will be the home of doc on for contributors to the Rackspace API doc  published at docs.rackspace.com.

Until we write that up nicely, here's the basic process:

1. In github.com/rackerlabs/, find the source repo for the document you want to change. Our doc source repos are named docs- followed by a product name.

2. In the source repo for the document you want to change, use git to commit your change and submit a pull request. 

3. An Information Developer responsible for that document will see your pull request, handle it appropriately, and republish the document if appropriate.

----
We are opening our source repos a few at a time. Retry https://github.com/rackerlabs/?query=docs- to see whether something new is available.  

----
If a document's source is not available in github.com/rackerlabs/ or you prefer not to use git, you can give us feedback and suggestions by other means:

* PUBLIC FEEDBACK
    * at docs.rackspace.com, open a document, scroll to the bottom of any page, and use Disqus to post a comment
    * reply to "Talk about Doc" in the Rackspace community at https://community.rackspace.com/general/f/34/t/565

* PRIVATE FEEDBACK
    * send email to rose.coste@rackspace.com and she'll route it to the right Information Developer(s)

----
Thank you for helping us improve Rackspace API documentation.
