docs-how-to-contribute
======================
This is the guide itself. In the directory structure, look higher for pom.xml (instructions to Maven about formatting the guide) and deeper for parts to be assembled into the guide.

* *how2-styleguide* is source for the style guide
* directories include parts (samples, figures, etc) to be included in the style guide
