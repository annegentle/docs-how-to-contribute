# Developer Guide - Prototype
  

## Introduction

This guide helps writers create and adapt documentation for developers. This guide upholds the DevEx docs mission:

    "Our docs are a trustworthy guide so developers can invent powerful applications."

## Humanity as a Service

Above all, what we do is explain things. When you write documentation, make sure you're explaining to an actual person other than yourself.

Structure docs around user tasks, not feature completeness.

Maximum clarity is good, but it's easy for us to fall into the trap of writing sterile doc: text purged of humanity. I am not encouraging us to load up on colloquialisms or adopt an overly familiar tone; I am saying that we must write with human empathy for a human audience.

### Know your audience

| Is | Is Not |
|:--:|:------:|
| Entreprenurial | Low spend, high support |
| Inventive | Homework kiddies |
| Comparison shopping | 100% Classical Developers |
| Efficiency-based | Want to ? (Illegible) |
| Educated on cloud options | |
| DIY | |
| Automation seeking | |
| Mid to high spend, targeted support needs | |

We need to have a larger conversation around user personas and doc metrics: how does Rackspace determine its doc audience? What are the empirical tools we use? It's all well and good to encourage empathetic writing, but empathy thrives on specificity: *for whom* do our docs show empathy? How do we know?

### Write empathetically

Empathy is **the ability to identify and share the needs of another**. Writing empathetically requires us as writers to know our users' needs and adopt them as our own, advocating for users' best interests with clear, concise documentation.

Empathetic docs demonstrate care for readers' needs. Instead of approaching your documents with the goal of documenting a feature, approach them with the goal of anticipating a reader's needs.

### Establish trust

Set expectations, then meet them consistently--through formatting, navigation, accuracy, and completeness.

Reduce the burden of discovery. Improve users' access to information by minimizing click distance (for example, with one-page docs) and improving searchability.

Provide accurate, complete information. Verify that code samples are functional and ready for use.

### Document user tasks

Structure docs to guide users through tasks. Feature-completeness is important, but it becomes truly useful when presented as a guide for users to get things done.

### Weight topics appropriately

Lavishly document error states and edge cases. Which errors are users most likely to encounter? What are the most common fixes? How can users get more help if they need it?

### Embrace paradox

Avoid jargon *and* be specific.

Write with warmth *and* avoid an overly familiar tone.

Provide generous depth *and* omit needless words.
